# CarTrail: Saves and directs you to your parking spot!

<br></br>

### What does this app do?:
> Saves your location and allows you to open a map to see where you saved a location. Clicking the pin will allow you to get directions to your saved location!

### Why does it exist?:
> I did this project as part of a coursework/research for my A-Levels (EPQ to be percise). I also did it to learn Android app development and to learn Java.

### Will you add "_insert/change feature here_" ?
> ***No***. Midway through development, I found out that this feature <sub>(although buried deep in the app)</sub> exists in both Google and Apple Maps. So, err, no point in progressing in the development of the app.

### Theoretically, this app saves a location of anything, not just a parking spot...
> Yes, I know. Just play along and use it only for parking spaces &nbsp; &nbsp; d=====(￣▽￣*)b

### So why don't you rebrand it?
> Too much effort. Refer to the third question

>[!WARNING]
> I wouldn't use for real-life scenarios. There is a bug on newer Android versions where the locations you saved disappear when the app is removed from RAM. Yep, it's **THAT** useless! Feel free to fix it though if you'd like :)
